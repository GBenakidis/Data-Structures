## Data Structures

Welcome to the Data Structures, a collection of three exciting projects that explore and demonstrate various data structures and their applications in C. Each project in this repository showcases a unique aspect of data structures and algorithms, making it a valuable resource for understanding and experimenting with these fundamental concepts.

**Project 1: Integer Compositions**
*Integer Compositions* is a C program that generates and prints all possible combinations of positive integers that add up to a given positive integer provided by the user. This project utilizes a stack data structure and recursive techniques to generate these compositions efficiently. The code has been thoughtfully organized into functions for modularity, making it easy to understand and experiment with integer compositions.

**Project 2: GrayCode Encode and Decode**
*GrayCode Encode and Decode* is a C project that implements a binary tree-based text encoding and decoding system. It introduces the concept of constructing binary trees, encoding text messages, and decoding encoded messages using Gray codes. The project is divided into multiple files, promoting modularity and clarity. *main.c* contains the primary program logic, *node.c* manages binary tree structures, *gray_tree.c* handles Gray code-based tree operations, and *encode.c* is responsible for message encoding and decoding.

**Project 3: Dictionary**
*Dictionary* is a comprehensive C application designed for efficient word searches and retrieval of word meanings. It explores two different strategies to optimize word lookups. The first approach employs separate chaining in a hash table, ensuring efficient word storage and retrieval with minimal collisions. The second method leverages the QuickSort algorithm to sort words and store them in an array of structures, significantly enhancing search performance. Both strategies utilize a prime multiplier-based hashing technique for effective word indexing and collision prevention. 

In summary, this repository is an educational repository that not only demonstrates data structure concepts but also provides an opportunity to experiment and gain practical experience with these fundamental elements of computer science. Whether you are a student, a developer, or simply a curious mind, this collection of projects will enhance your understanding of data structures and their real-world applications. We encourage you to explore and enjoy these projects, learn from them, and use them as a foundation for further exploration of data structures.
